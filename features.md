# Skill Changes
Following is the changes VPP adds for skills:
- Changes the skill leveling limit to be 20 instead of 10
- Adds an overlay in skills page to display your progress (Shown only if you have at least one skill above level 10)
- Adds craftables between levels 11-14 and 16-19 (Vanilla skills only)
- Locks Mastery Cave to be behind leveling up all skills to level 20. (Can be changed via config.json or GMCM menu)

## New Skill Levels
VPP changes the highest skill level for vanilla skills to 20 from 10. This is not configurable due to a lot of mod features rely on this.

# Professions
VPP adds a total of 50 professions for all vanilla skills:
- 40 of these can be chosen at level 15 but your options will depend on what have you chosen at level 5 and 10. 
- The rest 10 of them (which are named Combined or Combo Professions) can be chosen at level 20, but will ignore what you chose at levels 5, 10 and 15.

Every profession you see with '(Lv15)' can be chosen at level 15, and '(Lv20)' means that it will appear in level 20.

## Farming Professions

### Nutritionist (Lv15)
Machines that take coop animal goods have a chance to double their output. (Machinery as in Mayonnaise machine or loom, but VPP doesn't try to keep track of wool comes from whether a sheep or a rabbit as that'd require effort that isn't worth it imho.)

For Mod Authors: If your animal(s) live in the coop and their products use machines that aren't Mayonnaise Machine or Loom, you should add ``StackModifiers`` to your rules to double the amount of the output. You can use the ``HasProfession`` token to detect if the player has this profession.
### Breeder (Lv15)
Coop animals are worth more when sold.

For Mod Authors: You don't need to do anything, as VPP will automatically detect your animal if it lives in any vanilla coop.
### Musterer (Lv15)
Machines that take barn animal goods work faster.
Loom, Mayonnaise machine (only for ostrich eggs) and cheese presses will work faster.

For Mod Authors: If your animal(s) live in the barn and their products use machines that aren't Loom or Cheese Press, or if they use Mayonnaise Machine you should add ``ReadyTimeModifiers`` to the said machinery to make the your produce faster. You can use the ``HasProfession`` token to detect if the player has this profession.
### Caretaker (Lv15)
Milk pail and shears take no energy. Chance for hay eaten by animals to not be consumed. The chance for animals to not eat hay is %35, and its evaluated for every animal individually.

For Mod Authors: For custom animals, you don't need to do anything as VPP will apply these effects automatically for any animal. If you add any custom tools for animals, you'll have to check if the player has a profession with the ID of ``33``.
### Machinist (Lv15)
Machines that take harvested crops work faster.
Preserves Jar, Keg and Oil Maker will process 25% faster when the inputs are harvested crops.

For Mod Authors: If you add machinery that accept crops, you should add a ReadyTimeModifier that applies the same effect when
### Connoisseur (Lv15)
Artisan goods are loved by NPCs.
Most NPCs will love most artisan goods, but it wont automatically make every artisan good loved. Exclusion cases are mentioned below.

For Mod Authors: VPP chooses to ignore the characters or items in the following cases:
1) The item is alcoholic (has the ``alcohol_item`` context tag)
2) The NPC has it as a hated or disliked gift
3) The NPC has an entry of ``"Kedi.VPP.ExcludeFromConnoisseur": "true"`` in their Data/Characters entry's CustomFields
So if you want to exclude an item for your NPC fully or just have it ignore your NPC/item, add any of those
### Horticulturist (Lv15)
Trees grown in greenhouses will give iridium-quality produce.

For Mod Authors: There's nothing you should do to add compatibility with this profession.
### Agronomist (Lv15)
If a crop is grown outside of a greenhouse, chance for fertilizer to not be consumed.
Once you choose this profession, for every fertilizer you use outside of a greenhouse, each time its got a %30 chance to not be consumed. Gem dusts made with geode crushers are also affected by this profession.

For Mod Authors: Crop modders do not have to do anything, but for mods that add custom fertilizers, you might need to check if the player has a profession with the ID of ``37``.
### Farming-Mining (Lv20)
This profession allows you to use the Geode Crusher to produce Gem Dusts out of minerals, which you can use in place of fertilizers (gem dusts are affected by Agronomist profession as well.)
Which type of effect they give depends on their price and color:

| Color                  | Effect             |
|:----------------------:|:------------------:|
| Green, black<br/>dark brown | Tree Fertilizer    |
| Red<br/>Purple & Pink        | Speed-Gro          |
| Orange<br/>Yellow & Brown    | Quality Fertilizer |
| Blue, Cyan<br/>White, Gray   | Retaining Soil     |

| Price Range      | Strength Of Effect |
|:----------------:|:------------------:|
| < 120g           | Low[^3]            |
| >= 120g & <=280g | Medium[^3]         |
| > 280g           | High[^3]           |

[^3]: Doesn't affect Tree Fertilizer Gem Dusts

For Mod Authors: If you add custom minerals, they should have an appropriate color tag and be in the minerals category. If both of those are met, VPP will make gem dusts of your custom mineral too.
### Farming-Foraging (Lv20)
Fruit trees and giant crops are tappable.
You can now tap any giant crop and fruit tree with any tapper. Every 5 days that the tapper isn't removed, it will yield either a custom item defined by the game data (goes only for custom giant crops and fruit tree) or a Fruit Syrup flavored with the crop or fruit of the giant crop/fruit tree. 

- For Mod Authors: If you want your fruit tree or giant crop to give a custom item instead of a Fruit Syrup, you should add an entry like ``"Kedi.VPP.DoesUseCustomItem": "Example.ModID_UnqualifiedItemID"`` to the fruit tree/giant crop data's CustomFields. Otherwise you don't have to do anything other than giving your fruit tree or giant crop at least one fruit/crop.
## Fishing Professions

### Oceanologist (Lv15)

For Mod Authors: If you add custom monsters that aren't added via FTM content packs and not named ``RockCrab``, ``MetalHead``, ``HotHead``, ``DwarvishSentry`` in the game code (or isn't subclasses of any of these), contact me for compatibility with your mod. Otherwise you don't need to do anything.
### Assailant (Lv15)
No cooldowns after critical hits.

For Mod Authors: There's nothing you should do to add compatibility with this profession.
### Combat-Farming (Lv20)
Slimes in the slime hutch also produce valuable items.
When you leave your slimes without water, they'll produce Colored Petrified Slimes or Prismatic Slimes, which are valuable.

For Mod Authors: There's nothing you should do to add compatibility with this profession.
### Combat-Fishing (Lv20)
Fish can be used as slingshot ammo.
You read it right. Fish on slingshots. The damage the fish will do depends on how expensive it is.

For Mod Authors: There's nothing you should do to add compatibility with this profession.
# Talents
## What even is this?
VPP adds a skill point system named 'talents' which is built from ground to the top. Every talent is a perk purchasable with 'talent points', and each of them change a different aspect of the game.
Its said to be alike Skyrim's skill trees, but to be quite honest I haven't played it so I can't confirm nor deny.

## How do I get talent points?

|         Way to obtain          |  Talent points obtainable |
|:------------------------------:|:-------------------------:|
| Levelling up in any skill      | 1 (each level up)         |
| Completing Achievements        | 1 (each achievement)      |
| Succeeding in Qi's Challenges  | 1 (only once per SO)      |
| Achieving Perfection           | 10                        |

## Can I reset my talents?
You are allowed to reset the trees as often as you want, but you have to use one of:
- Stardrop Tea: To reset the tree you're currently viewing
- Prismatic Shard: To reset all trees at once

VPP wont allow you to reset if you haven't used any points yet (at all or since the last reset),
and after requesting the reset you have to confirm or abort so you can't accidentally waste items or initiate using both items.

## What do each talent do exactly? I'd like to spoil myself.
It adds a grand total of 141 talents divided across 6 skill trees, 25 for each vanilla skill and 16 extras for one tree that isn't spesific to any skills.

Note: Said rings spawned from CJB or SMAPI console will not be functional because both of those wont do some necessary changes VPP does.

For Mod Authors: If you add custom trinkets, you need to add a custom ring item, and add an entry like ``"Kedi.VPP.AccessoriseRing": "ExampleAuthor.ExampleMod_UnqualifiedItemIDForMyRing"`` to your trinket's TrinketMetadata field. This is needed for VPP to match your trinket to your ring.

For Mod Authors: If you're a custom NPC author and want your NPC(s) affected by this talent, you need to add an entry to Insider Info's data. The format DOES NOT accept context tags or category IDs. You can get the target path for the data by using the ``ContentPaths`` token. The key must be the NPC's internal name, and the value should be a space-delimited list of UNQUALIFIED item IDs. For exp: ``"Abigail": "123 456 789 102 425"``
### Gift of Friendship
The villagers will start giving you gifts after you're close enough to them to show their gratitude. The gifts are usually the villagers' loved and liked gifts.

For Mod Authors: If you're a custom NPC author and want your NPC(s) affected by this talent, you should add a CT response for ``VPP.GiftOfFriendship`` in their dialogue file, with a when condition if they have 8 hearts or above with the farmer. You're allowed to make it less or more than 8 hearts depending on how your character is like, its just what I set vanilla NPCs to react to.
